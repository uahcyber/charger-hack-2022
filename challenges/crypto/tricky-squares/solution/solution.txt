To solve this it can be bruteforced or it can be done by hand using a Vigenere Square. 
If use the key, which is "Italy", then you first have to align the key and the cipher text by
repeating the key until the end of the ciphertext.

	NEA RRP XSB SIK ETQ BAE VCQ
	ITA LYI TAL LYI TAL YIT ALY	

Then you have to find the row of the letter in the key in the Vigenere Square and find 
the letter in the ciphertext. The column that the ciphertext letter is in will correspond 
with the plaintext letter. This will leave you with the following. 

	FLA GTH ESQ UAR EIS THE KEY

Which in the proper format is:
	
	FLAG{THE_SQUARE_IS_THE_KEY}
